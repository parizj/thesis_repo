Retrospective Analysis of Profitability in Sports Betting Using Machine Learning (Master's Thesis)

The diploma thesis focuses on the utilization of artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning models, in the field of sports betting. In the first part of the research, machine learning models are trained on tennis match data, and subsequently, the most successful model is selected based on its predictive accuracy. Following this, algorithms are developed for each chosen betting strategy, to which both the predictions generated by the machine learning model and the odds provided by bookmakers are applied. Finally, the profitability of each betting strategy is compared using the created predictions in comparison with the odds provided by bookmakers.
